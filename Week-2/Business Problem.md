<h2> Business Problem for the Car Accident Severity Problem </h2><hr>
<br><br>
<p> In my Data Science Capstone Project, I'll be working on the dataset for severity of the car accidents in Seattle.<br><br>
In a society where more and more people are able to buy a car, having safe road conditions and responsible drivers is becoming of utmost importance. 
With the numer of vehicles on the road at an all time high, the road accidents are also moving in an upward trend.<br><br>
Through this project, I'll be trying to find out the causes or factors that caused the accidents and what type of collisions lead to injuries(basically the severity of the accident).<br><br>
This will be helpful for the <b>Civil Authorities</b> in tackling the issues with efficiency and ensuring everyone on the road are as safe as they can be.</p>
